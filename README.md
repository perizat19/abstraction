### ABSTRACTION IN 3D SHAPE MODELING

### Abstract class: 
In this project, I created abstract class, called Shape3D. There are abstract methods, such as surface_area() and volume(), in the class.
### Sphere class:
The second class is Sphere class. It requires one attribute, radius. There are such methods as 1)__str__() method, that displays the shape type; 2)Overritten surface_area() and volume()
mehtods, that calculate the shape's area and volume.
### Cylinder class:
The third class is Cylinder class. It requires two attributes, radius and height. There are such methods as 1)__str__() method, that displays the shape type; 2)Overritten surface_area() and volume()
mehtods, that calculate the shape's area and volume.
### Cube class:
The fourth class is Cubw class. It requires one attribure, side. There are such methods as 1)__str__() method, that displays the shape type; 2)Overritten surface_area() and volume()
mehtods, that calculate the shape's area and volume.


### Main file
In the main file, I created empty list for adding objects in it. Next, using for loop, I created 10 objects with their attributes, that were randomly generated. All the objects were added to the 
empty list.
Then, I again used for loop in order to output each object's type, area and volume.

Here is the result:
